BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities
you usually find in fileutils, shellutils, findutils, textutils, grep, gzip,
tar, etc.  BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small
or emdedded system.  The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options then
their full featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide 
the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts.
<p>
BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind.
It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude commands (or
features) at compile time.  This makes it easy to customize your embedded
systems.  To create a working system, just add a kernel, a shell (such as ash),
and an editor (such as elvis-tiny or ae).

BusyBox is now maintained by 
<a href="http://www.xmission.com/~andersen/erik/erik.html">

    <p> <li> <b>19 April 2000 -- syslogd bugfix</b>
    <br>
        Turns out that there was still a bug in busybox syslogd.
	For example, with the following test app:
<pre>
	#include &lt;syslog.h&gt

	int do_log(char* msg, int delay)
	{
	    openlog("testlog", LOG_PID, LOG_DAEMON);
	    while(1) {
	        syslog(LOG_ERR, "%s: testing one, two, three\n", msg);
	        sleep(delay);
	    }
	    closelog();
	    return(0);
	};

	int main(void)
	{
	    if (fork()==0)
	        do_log("A", 2);
	    do_log("B", 3);
	}
</pre>
	it should be logging stuff from both "A" and "B".  As released in 0.43 only stuff
	from "A" would have been logged.  This means that if init tries to log something
	while say ppp has the syslog open, init would block (which is bad, bad, bad).
	<p>
	Karl M. Hegbloom has created a 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/busybox-0.43-syslog_patch">fix for the problem</a>.
	Thanks Karl!


    <p> <li> <b>18 April 2000 -- BusyBox 0.43 released (finally!)</b>
    <br>
        I have finally gotten everything into a state where I feel pretty
	good about things.  This is definitely the most stable, solid release
	so far.  A lot of bugs have been fixed, and the following new apps
	have been added: sh, basename, dirname, killall, uptime, 
	freeramdisk, tr, echo, test, and usleep.  Tar has been completely
	rewritten from scratch.  Bss size has also been greatly reduced.
	More details are available in the 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a>.
	Oh, and as a special bonus, I wrote some fairly comprehensive
	<em>documentation</em>, complete with examples and full usage information.

	<p>
	Many thanks go out to the fine people that have helped by submitting patches
	and bug reports; particularly instrumental in helping for this release were 
	Karl Hegbloom, Pavel Roskin, Friedrich Vedder, Emanuele Caratti,
	Bob Tinsley, Nicolas Pitre, Avery Pennarun, Arne Bernin, John Beppu, and Jim Gleason.
	There were others so if I somehow forgot to mention you, I'm very sorry.
	<p>

	You can grab BusyBox 0.43 tarballs <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/">here</a>.

    <p> <li> <b>9 April 2000 -- BusyBox 0.43 pre release</b>
    <br>
        Unfortunately, I have not yet finished all the things I want to
        do for BusyBox 0.43, so I am posting this pre-release for people
        to poke at.  This contains my complete rewrite of tar, which now weighs in at
        5k (7k with all options turned on) and works for reading and writing
        tarballs (which it does correctly for everything I have been able to throw
        at it).  Tar also (optionally) supports the "--exclude" option (mainly because
        the Linux Router Project folks asked for it).  This also has a pre-release
        of the micro shell I have been writing.  This pre-release should be stable
        enough for production use -- it just isn't a release since I have some structural
        changes I still want to make.
        <p>
	The pre-release can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/">here</a>.
	Please let me know ASAP if you find <em>any</em> bugs.
    
    <p> <li> <b>28 March 2000 -- Andersen Baby Boy release</b>
    <br>
	I am pleased to announce that on Tuesday March 28th at 5:48pm, weighing in at 7
	lbs. 12 oz, Micah Erik Andersen was born at LDS Hospital here in Salt Lake City.
	He was born in the emergency room less then 5 minutes after we arrived -- and
	it was such a relief that we even made it to the hospital at all.  Despite the
	fact that I was driving at an amazingly unlawful speed and honking at everybody
	and thinking decidely unkind thoughts about the people in our way, my wife
	(inconsiderate of my feelings and complete lack of medical training) was lying
	down in the back seat saying things like "I think I need to start pushing now"
	(which she then proceeded to do despite my best encouraging statements to the
	contrary).
	<p>
	Anyway, I'm glad to note that despite the much-faster-than-we-were-expecting
	labor, both Shaunalei and our new baby boy are doing wonderfuly.
	<p>
	So now that I am done with my excuse for the slow release cycle...
	Progress on the next release of BusyBox has been slow but steady.  I expect
	to have a release sometime during the first week of April.  This release will
	include a number of important changes, including the addition of a shell, a 
	re-write of tar (to accomodate the Linux Router Project), and syslogd can now
	accept multiple concurrent connections, fixing lots of unexpected blocking 
	problems.


    <p> <li> <b>11 February 2000 -- BusyBox 0.42 released</b>
    <br>

	     This is the most solid BusyBox release so far.  Many, many
		bugs have been fixed.   See the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">changelog</a> for details.

		Of particular interest, init will now cleanly unmount 
		filesystems on reboot, cp and mv have been rewritten and 
		behave much better, and mount and umount no longer leak 
		loop devices.  Many thanks go out to Randolph Chung, 
		Karl M. Hegbloom, Taketoshi Sano, and Pavel Roskin for 
		their hard work on this release of BusyBox.  Please pound 
		on it and let me know if you find any bugs.

    <p> <li> <b>19 January 2000 -- BusyBox 0.41 released</b>
    <br>

	     This release includes bugfixes to cp, mv, logger, true, false,
		mkdir, syslogd, and init.  New apps include wc, hostid, 
		logname, tty, whoami, and yes.  New features include loop device
		support in mount and umount, and better TERM handling by init.
		The changelog can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">here</a>.

    <p> <li> <b>7 January 2000 -- BusyBox 0.40 released</b>
    <br>

	     This release includes bugfixes to init (now includes inittab support),
	     syslogd, head, logger, du, grep, cp, mv, sed, dmesg, ls, kill, gunzip, and mknod.
	     New apps include sort, uniq, lsmod, rmmod, fbset, and loadacm.
	     In particular, this release fixes an important bug in tar which 
	     in some cases produced serious security problems.
	     As always, the changelog can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">here</a>.

    <p> <li> <b>11 December 1999 -- BusyBox Website</b>
    <br>
	     I have received permission from Bruce Perens (the original author of BusyBox)
		to set up this site as the new primary website for BusyBox.  This website
		will always contain pointers to the latest and greatest, and will also 
		contain the latest documentation on how to use BusyBox, what it can do,
		what arguments its apps support, etc.

    <p> <li> <b>10 December 1999 -- BusyBox 0.39 released</b>
    <br>
	     This release includes fixes to init, reboot, halt, kill, and ls, and contains 
	     the new apps ping, hostname, mkfifo, free, tail, du, tee, and head.  A full
	     changelog can be found <a href="ftp://ftp.lineo.com/pub/busybox/Changelog">here</a>.
    <p> <li> <b>5 December 1999 -- BusyBox 0.38 released</b>
    <br>
	     This release includes fixes to tar, cat, ls, dd, rm, umount, find, df, 
		and make install, and includes new apps syslogd/klogd and logger.

<ul> 

    <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/shells/ash.html">ash</a>
    is a very small Bourne shell. If you need a shell for your embedded systems, this is it.    
    <p>
                
    <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/base/ae.html">ae</a>
    is a tiny full-screen text editor with both modal (vi-like) and modeless 
    (emacs-like) modes, determined by an ae.rc config file. It makes a nice editor 
    if people that don't know "vi" will need to work on your embedded system.            
    <p>

    <li> <a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/base/elvis-tiny.html">elvis-tiny</a>
    is based on a 1991 Minix version of the elvis "vi" clone. It behaves as one would 
    expect a minamalist vi to behave, and is very small.
    <p>

    <li> <a href="http://www.asty.org/nano/">nano</a>
    A small GPLed pico clone that makes a nice editor for people that don't know "vi".
    <p>

    <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/iproute.html">iproute</a>
    Much more flexible replacement for ifconfig, route, etc. It is quite small, and for 
    most networking applications, it is all you need. It also provides support for extremely 
    advanced networking and provides Quality of Service(QoS) support, but most people will 
    just need to use the "ip" command and will not even need to install the rest.
    <p>

    <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/pump.html">Pump</a>
    This is the DHCP/BOOTP client written by RedHat. When compiled properly, it 
    gives you dhcp client support for about 35k.                
    <p>

    <li><a href="http://www.pcug.org.au/~dbell/">sash</a>
    The Stand Alone SHell.  This is a small shell (not Bourne shell compatable) 
    that is similar to busybox in that it provides a number of common utilities as built-ins.
    <p>
    
    <li><a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/newlib/">NewLib</a>
    This is a small C library intended for use on embedded systems.  If you are finding
    GNU libc is a bit too big for your applications, try NewLib and it may help.
    <p>
                
    <li><a href="http://linuxassembly.org/asmutils.html">asmutils</a>
    asmutils is similar to BusyBox in that it provides a number of common application
    for embedded systems that are very tiny.  In fact, they are a _lot_ smaller than the
    equivalent apps in busybox -- but the price you pay for the size is reduced portability 
    (x86 only) and interfaces that are tied directly to a perticular kernel (no libc involved).
    <p>
                
    <li><a href="http://tinylogin.lineo.com/">TinyLogin</a>
    is a nice embedded tool for handling authentication, changing passwords,
    and similar tasks, and which nicely complements BusyBox.
