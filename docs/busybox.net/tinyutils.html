<tr>
 <td>SSH</td>
 <td><a href="http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/">Dropbear</a> has both an ssh server and an ssh client that together come in around 100k.  It has no external
dependencies (I.E. it does not depend on OpenSSL, using a built-in copy of
LibTomCrypt instead).  It's actively maintained, with a quiet but responsive
mailing list.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>SMTP</td>
 <td><a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/ssmtp/">ssmtp</a> is an extremely simple MTA.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>Microperl</td>
 <td><a href=http://www.foo.be/docs/tpj/issues/vol5_3/tpj0503-0003.html>microperl</a> is a small standalone perl interpreter that can be built from the perl sources via "make -f Makefile.micro".  If you really feel the need for perl on an embedded system, this is where to start.  (If you just want a small embedded
scripting language to write _new_ code in,
<a href=http://www.lua.org/pil/>Lua</a> seems popular for this purpose</a>.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In a gui environment, you'll probably want a web browser.
<a href="http://www.konqueror.org/embedded/">Konqueror Embedded</a> requires QT
(or QT Embedded), but not KDE.  The <a href="http://www.dillo.org/">Dillo</a>
requires GTK+, but not Gnome.  Or you can try the <a href="http://links.twibright.com/">graphical
version of links</a>.</p>

<p>For more information, you probably want to look at
<a href=http://buildroot.uclibc.org>buildroot</a> and
<a href=http://gentoo-wiki.com/TinyGentoo>TinyGentoo</a>, which
build and use tiny utilities for all sorts of things.</p>
