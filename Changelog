1.00-pre1

    Preparing for a new Stable Series.  Because so amazingly much has changed
    since the last stable series (but mostly because I am feeling too lazy to
    spend the next hour writing up a list of everything new and different),
    I'll stick with a simple summary.

    *) Many many new applets have been added.
    *) We have an entirely new configuration system based on
	the Linux kernel config system.
    *) Most applets have more features, more configurable options,
	and are more standards compliant.
