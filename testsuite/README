To run the test suite, change to this directory and run
"./runtest".  It will run all of the test cases, and list those
with unexpected outcomes.  Adding the -v option will cause it to
show expected outcomes as well.  To only run the test cases for
particular applets, specify them as parameters to runtest.

The test cases for an applet reside in the subdirectory of the
applet name.  The name of the test case should be the assertion
that is tested.  The test case should be a shell fragment that
returns successfully if the test case passes, and unsuccessfully
otherwise.  If the test case is known to fail, it should be marked
as such by including the string "XFAIL" in a comment.  If a
certain feature must be enabled for it to pass, it should indicate
that by including the string "UNSUPPORTED: " followed by the
feature name in a comment.

For the entire testsuite, the copyright is as follows:
