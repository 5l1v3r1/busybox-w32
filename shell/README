Various bits of what is known about busybox shells, in no particular order.

hush: removed setsid() and made job control sort-of-sometimes-work.
Ctrl-C in "rm -i" works now except for SH_STANDALONE case.
"sleep 1 | exit 3" + "echo $?" works, "sleep 1 | exit 3; echo $?"
shows exitcode 0 (should be 3). "sleep 1 | sleep 2 &" fails horribly.

lash, hush: both do setsid() and as a result don't have ctty!
Ctrl-C doesn't work for any child (try rm -i), etc...
lash: bare ">file" doesn't create a file (hush works)
