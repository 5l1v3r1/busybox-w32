 ABOUT:
 ------

This is a straight rip from the e2fsprogs pkg.

These files are used to support other misc progs ripped out of e2fsprogs 
and included in busybox.

 -------
 UPDATE:
 -------

Simply copy the 'e2p' dir from e2fsprogs/lib/ and then delete the extra 
files we don't need (Makefile.in, e2p.pc.in, etc...).  Update the e2p.h 
file to look for "../ext2_fs.h" instead of <ext2fs/ext2_fs.h>.  Finally, 
remove the _LARGEFILE* define's from the few source files that use it 
since we'll be appending it ourselves to CFLAGS when we compile.

Last ripped from the e2fsprogs-1.37 release.
